# T2D-prediction-automated-feature-engineering
This repository shows the codes used to explore the effectiveness of Automated Feature Engineering in combination with a Hybrid Data-Driven Feature selection approach using the Whitehall II Dataset. 

The title of the thesis that explored this was: "Type 2 Diabetes Prediction Using Automated Feature Engineering and Data-Driven Feature Selection - Revealing Undiscovered Predictors". The main goal was to compare the features that are engineered and selected through a manual approach, with the features derived through an automated approach. 

The data used for this research is not publicly available. The code made available in this repository functions as a guideline to replicate the proposed method using different data.
